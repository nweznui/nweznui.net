                    this one was a strange mix of peaceful, alienating, and creepy. and it took place on an island again. wonder why thats a repeating theme in my dreams. i stay with a family of skinwalkers, i run away and play with children on the beach, i meet animals and become them.

                   basically i'm going on holiday and i'm invited to stay at a family's house. and its a big, white, very 50s nuclear type family. they are very obviously "fake", like mannequins, and have pasted on smiles. I sit a dinner table and they pass around food for a thanksgiving feast. i feel scared and trapped in the ritual at first, but then realize i dont have to participate if i don't want to. i get up from the table and go outside. the family doesn't seem to notice i've left and continues the ritual.</p>
                   <p> there are lots of beautiful swaying palm trees. i traverse down a hillside and some steps that lead to a beach. some old friends of mine and my partner are already there, near the tall grasses, away from the waves, waving hello. i wave back from a distance but i dont feel the urge to go to them, i just know they're okay. i see the water and there are lots of children playing.</p>
                   <p>i'm concerned for their safety so decide to accompany them. i end up enjoying their company and decide to join in on the play, splashing, having them ride on my shoulders. some seabirds land in the water next to us and we pet them. the dream ends.</p>
                  <hr class="hr-1">
                  <p>
                   my memory of this dream is a little sparse, i really should've written it as soon as i woke up. lately, i've noticed i dont feel the urge to impress others anymore nor follow social conventions for the sake of self preservation. i guess since i've stopped myself from drawing for so long my mind has become more comfortable with more public forms of self expression. i feel braver, less afraid of being alone. i care a lot less about what others think. and the birds in this dream came towards me this time instead of away. i hope that means i still have hope of preserving my integrity, enjoying my life but finding practical ways of practicing sincerity and humanism in a world conductive to dishonesty and swindling.

                  <p>I had a dream involving u<br>
                    I lived at my old house again and i was totally alone on christmas, u were the only person to send me a gift<br>
                     In the mail u sent me a giant Tupperware container full of baby ducklings<br>
                    And for some reason u told me i could only open it on a cloudy or rainy day<br>
                    It was raining the day u sent it so i opened it<br>
                    All of them were hungry some of them were dead<br>
                    I frantically looked for ways to take care of them but i couldnt even turn on the lights to keep them warm, each one i turned on blew out and i was forced to live in the dark<br>
                    Then lots of different animals came marching through my room, zoo animals, domestic etc etc<br>
                    And they led me to look outside my window where i saw in my old swimming pool lots of baby swans<br>
                    When they noticed me they all swam away</p>
                    <hr class="hr-1">
                    <p>
                    i interpret it as like, my fear about preserving my innocence<br>
                    because preserving my innocence also means preserving my artistic freedom<br>
                    i see you as someone who above all else manages to guard their artistic freedom and practices sincerity above all else<br>
                    so i wonder if you sending me the ducklings was sort of me wanting to share that ability, to guard my innocence, to not get distracted superficial/material matters and remember what is most important to me<br>
                    and of course, me not being able to keep them warm, just feels like my frantic failures in preserving my sense of self<br>
                  random and out of my control<br>
                and i think the baby swans swimming away is sort of like me feeling dissapointed with my own efforts<br>
                to balance my artistic life with my "adult" responsibilities<br>
                because right now my artistic life is very neglected<br>
                i know when i come back itll be with a vengeance. but after 50hrs a week of studying and working im tired

                      so this ones a two parter x) cause im too lazy to do two seperate entries and these dreams were close together. finally some dreams i feel like are worth documenting.
    					     </span><span class="dots">...</span>
                  <span class="more">
                    <p>the first one is fairly short and straightforward. i meet a girl randomly, we start getting along, she invites me to her front yard to hang out and talk about anime. she has a miku lawn ornament, and some stickers on her car of various vocaloid and popular anime characters. it was nice, we made cosplays together and went to a comic convention. we become friends. </p>
                    <p> i used to have a friend like this in real life, but we had quite an age gap and i think it deterred her from getting closer i guess. i wasn't cool enough. i mean which kind of makes sense, it was significant enough that it'd be like hanging out with a 11 year old little sister. but i remember really craving friendship from her. i didnt have any friends at school at the time and we shared a lot of interests. she sort of just hung out with me i think, cause it was encouraged by my caregiver at the time.</p>
                    <p> so yeah the interpretation is obvious. i want a girl friend i can have fun with and go to events and things to. i'm really lonely in real life, my fiance is my only friend and we kind of have opposite schedules right now so many of my waking hours are spent alone or at work. i sort of have work friends at work but, we're not close enough to hang out after work or anything. after this dream, i just wanted to go back to sleep, and spend more time with this imaginary friend.</p>
                    <p>i feel embarassed, i turn 24 next year and, i still dont have many real life friends. i guess thats how i stay so dedicated to this blog, it's my only offerance of a parasocial relationship.</p>
                    <hr class="hr-1">
                    <p> the second dream takes place at my old boarding school. well, more like the neighboring town. i'm a cashier and we aren't allowed to talk or speak or laugh. the rules are very strict, we cant look people in the eyes and we are all in a straight little line. customers enjoy themselves, buy drinks, chat with each other. in defiance, i decidedly run away, and the place gets burned to the ground after i leave. i didn't set it on fire, but an accident or something just happened, simutaneously.</p>
                    <p> i run away to the woods and find myself in nature. i'm among valleys, tall grasses, swaths of coniferous and deciduous trees, in the rural northeast america. it's spring and wildflowers of various types of aster, babys breath, and thistle have settled and sprung from the crevices of rocks.</p>
                    <p> i meet some old classmates there, except theyre my friends. there is a group of 3-4 people waiting for me, and we go hiking together. the sky is very blue. when we go back home, we settle in a cathedral and sleep in its corridors, almost like squatters. we sleep at a top floor, it looks down into a great courtyard below paved with beautiful circular patterns of brick. i should draw it.</p>
                    <p> my boss from the "cashier" job follows me, so does her husband, they try to commend me back to work. i push her out the window, she flies away like a vulture.</p>
                    <p> yeah, i really miss hiking and being in nature. it was difficult to wake up from this one. i really loved the setting, i wanted to go back and explore that cathedral more and those prairies. it also reflects sort of, the nature of how i feel about work, which is tied down, no matter which way i construe it. but i could be a spoiled child that way. certainly, being homeless is not preferable, nor should it be some romantic ideal.</p>
                    <p> but i already starve myself because i am depressed at home. would there be much of a difference if i scavanged for food from dumpsters sometimes i wonder. sorry if this comes across as insenstitive to people who really know the reality, i'm just airing my naive, speculative thoughts.</p>

                    a lot of my dreams have been too chaotic and uncohesive to interpret anything from them, including this one, it is more like an arrangement of short stories loosely tied together. but i wanted to write about this one because i dont think i could stop thinking about it otherwise.
    					     </span><span class="dots">...</span>
                  <span class="more">
                    <p>so its hard to remember but, i was in my old house. i was trying to pay for it by "lightly prostituting" myself, that is, i didnt offer copulative services but ones where i would be paid to love someone via kissing, hugging, writing letters, going on dates. i did this from a convienence store. i remember feeling disgusted with myself coming back home.</p>
                    <p> when i came back i had some people i have never met before in my real life as friends, and they were helping me clean out my basement. i remember feeling grateful, but also wondering if they had ulterior motives in helping me, like nobody could be this kind without being expectant of something in return. there was a line of men outside expectantly waiting for me to go back on shift, so i wondered if they all wanted the same thing.</p>
                    <p> in my basement were many of my old childhood things. i was searching for my "rock collection", one of my favorite childhood objects-- it was just an assemblage of different types of polished and native ore rocks and gems essentially that came with their corresponding identifications. quartz, tigers eye, moonstone. but it was missing. i asked my "friends" if they had seen it and they hadnt.</p>
                    <p> i went upstairs from the basement to take a break, to find an endless grassy mown pasture. i was unable to explore it as there were two sets of wire fence and a moat that seperated me from the endless fields. while i was looking at the vista beyond, i turned to find a (real person i knew) former friend of mine holding my rock collection, he had walked from around the corner. he had gotten older, even though i was the same age, they looked like they were in their 50s and their hair and beard had gotten long and salt and peppery. he threw a piece of tigers eye to me, one of my favorite stones, but also a silver nugget that was very pure and shined very brightly. he said something to me. i kept trying to parse what he said, i kept begging him to repeat it. but he left. he took my rock collection with him.</p>
                    <p> i woke up very sad. but also very motivated. i realized if i dont finish my comic, i dont think i'll ever be able to let go of what happened. it has to be made whether it is good or not.the imaginative space is the only way i really let go of these things and stop thinking about them. </p>

    					     <span>
    					     this is kind of an upsetting one, involves a lot of detailed, gruesome death imagery, so please don't read on if you are not willing to read about such things. (don't blame you.) in order to document my dreams in full, i must include the ugly.<br>
    					      i moved to a city that was dispersed with plots of rural countryside and surrounded by forest. as i was getting established and making connections with others, a huge evangelion angel-like monster began an invasion upon the city. it was a tank, but with a giant drill attatched to the end of it. there were sirens,
    					     </span>
    			          <span class="dots">...</span>
                  <span class="more">
                  people yelling and screaming, mothers embracing their children close to their chest. the company i worked for was akin to NERV in eva, except i was trying to escort people to safety. 
                  <br><br>
                  but i kept having to watch gruesome scene after gruesome scene. people were enjoying themselves at the beach, the tank came through and flattened them all to a bloody paste. it barreled down parks, shops, apartment buildings, homes. i had to consolidate people, over and over, who couldn't be torn away from the unrecognizable remains of their loved ones. i had to force them out of their homes, and leave some behind knowing that they would succumb to the mosnter despite by best efforts to convince them to leave. and yet as much as i tried, the shelters werent enough. the only thing that would save you is actively running. the monster bore through the underground shelters, you could never settle in one place. <br><br>
                  after a certain point, much of the population was wiped and most of the city abandoned. the monster still lurked though it was more of a quiet, stalking, malignant presence, making itself known by the occasional mild earthquake. it left the remaining survivors alone for the most part, but never enough to feel secure. me and another survivor attempted to infltrate a hunter-gatherer tribe that had very little outside contact with the rest of the world. we found their hunting gear, fishing poles, spears, sandals thatd let you run across water. we caught a huge fish together, but we released the fish because it was pregnant. the tribe found us and was angry with us, we dropped most of their things and ran. through fields, across ponds, with the sandals. as soon as we lost them, we lay together near a fire we made, a shelter constructed out of the foundational remains of a dilapitated building.
                  <hr class="hr-1">
                  i've made a ton of changes in my life recently-- lost a couple of close friends, one permanently and one temporarily, im changing jobs, im moving to the city, i changed my degree. i have kinda had to bulldoze my way through situations get closer to the life i actually want. its left me feeling scared, isolated, i feel like i cant rest, i gotta keep moving, studying, packing, working. <br><br>
                  this dream manifested these fears in a very extreme way, funny enough, the anxiety i fear day-to-day doesn't feel like its quite on the same scale as life or death, as ive experienced many of these changes before. but maybe this dream isnt about just a recent cultimation of things, maybe its what the last 5 or so years has felt like-- running, hiding, never staying, never getting comfortable, never fully trusting, having to hurt others to save myself and confusion on whether it was necessary, whether the tallied acts made me selfish or selfless, cowardly or courageous. it certainly touches that fear of isolating myself in pursuing what i want in life.

    					      haven't had many interesting dreams lately, but this one was a super cool one. i drove out really far into the rural countryside, like states away, with all of my friends both online/irl, except we weren't our literal human selves or whatever. we were like more like impish creatures or earthbound enemy looking symbolic representations of ourselves. (i should draw it!) it was the dead of night and the snow was falling so heavy on the windshield, it looked like scifi light-speed travel through stars, except it was through a snowstorm.
    					     </span>
    			          </span><span class="dots">...</span>
                  <span class="more">
  			          we arrived at this giant warehouse-like building to spend the night in. my mom was there hosting it like it was an airbnb or something? but inside it was this gymnasium that used to be used for circus performers, with a really high ceiling. we all slept like cats, curled up in the giant net that acrobats use for safety. we didn't really have normal conversation. more like spoke in gurgles, animalike sounds, a mixture of animalcrossing animalese and q*bert type speak.
                  <br><br>
                  when we woke up it was still night. the outside was only accessible through the elevator to the rooftop, as the world had snowed in to the height of the building and trees.
                  i went outside to fly around and purposefully fall feet deep into the snow, over and over. it was really fun. some of my friends joined me. i did it as much as i could til i could see the sun rise, then my dream ended.
                  <hr class="hr-1">
                  this was a really enjoyable dream. it was nice to return with a calm one after sort of not having many the last week. i think this would be one worthy of creative material, as i had a similar dream a couple years ago: except i was completely alone and wandering in an abandoned snowy plot of land, only occupied by a farmhouse. maybe this one reflects my development in becoming more intimate and trusting with the people i know, both offline + online.

    					     another island dream, except instead of somewhere rural, this place was more of like a village that had parts that esclated into a city. i was taking a 'vacation' with some participants from my job. the island was populated but only with jet black humanoid figures who barely spoke, shared all the same face, when they spoke it was like a spell that would try to mislead you from your group. i felt weary the entire dream, trying to herd my group away from these 'folk' and often self sabotaging myself in the process</span><span class="dots">...</span>
                  <span class="more">
                  with many close calls to getting abducted, from where i would be threatened with imagery of hanging, my body walked around in a circle, some other worse threats which are a bit too much for me to recall. this kind of contrasted with the beauty of the dark tropical rainforest setting. there was a wall of noise-- birds chirping, monkeys grunting, frogs croaking in unison. it was wonderful, but it made it extremely hard to tell when i was being followed and when i was not.
                  <br><br>
                  <hr class="hr-1">
                  this one is harder to interpret, also a bit harder to recall as i woke up many times in the night last night, so thats why its sparser. its a pretty stark contrast to the clear serenity/peacefulness with the unpredictable in the last one. maybe this one has a specifically social aspect to it, like i still feel this need to protect myself from people specifically. because it wasn't the vastness and maze of the jungle that scared me, only the 'people' residing in it that felt the urge to harm me and the people i care about. 
                  
                  <br><br>
                  this does reflect my real life pretty well. i have a lot of trouble connecting with people and trusting them due to very undeveloped social skills from prolonged periods of isolation in my childhood. so much fear and social anxiety that i would be scared to even voice chat in games online, lol. i know my longing to connect is geniune, as i have people in my life now who i definetely feel an intimate sense of connection, for both my platonic friendships and my romantic one. maybe it's an aversion to the general public then? or it could be meaningless, sometimes dreams can just be anxious gibberish. i'll come back to this one...

                    had a dream i lived on a tropical island like honolulu except it wasn't highway infested haha. i would be reorganizing stuff or cleaning my house but every thirty minutes i would see a huge tsunami outside my window. when i first saw it the reflections of the water looked like clouds, so i thought it was just how outside normally looked like. but then it crashed on my house and instead of destroying everything, my house was just filled with a current of water</span><span class="dots">...</span>
                  <span class="more">
                    and i would be swept up among my furniture, somewhat gently. when it was over everything would somehow be dry and put back into place, my cats would be okay although a little damp, whatever i was cleaning or whatever art i was working on would be spotlessly clean.
                    one day i was walking along the island shore and i saw a magician putting on a show for children. he was pulling somehting out of his hat, and right before the final reveal, another tsunami towered over him. but nobody was scared, the children screamed with excitement, i was the only one a little nervous but not too frightened because i'd experienced it myself before. it came crashing down and everyone dispersed everywhere, children were laughing as the current twirled them weightlessly, the magician never revealed what came out of his hat, i felt confused and was swept gently back to the porchsteps of my own "house" (which is a house i've never lived in before, but a rather peaceful one i would like to live in!) this kept happening, but in various places: supermarkets, gardens, on ships, while visiting friends and family.

                   i like to think maybe it's my brain congratulating me for better being able to handle huge bouts of anxiety and internal chaos that arise in me from time to time. because a year ago i also had a dream involving a huge tsunami where i was terrified, running along the alleys of cities and squeezing through corridors trying to save my cat. but this dream was peaceful... like the tsunamis were taken as a given, part of daily life, things may seem discombobulated for a minute, but everything returns to a natural order. whether this has fully ingrained itself in me has yet to be tested. unlike many who suffer from anxiety at the end of the day i am always guaranteed food, housing, and blessed with my health. so at least i don't take that for granted anymore, i think.
