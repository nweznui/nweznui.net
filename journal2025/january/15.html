studying moomin in spanish today. i want to get to know D's family proper in their native language before we get married, so i've been taking spanish learning more seriously. the refold method has been really fun and intuitive. i feel quite relaxed just readling along and looking up words as i go, seeing words in their context. comprehensive input is sometimes dry if theres limited content that actually interests me, but i'll stick it through just cause when i get better more interesting stuff will be available eventually.<br>
i'm excited to learn a second language for the first time. i'm unlocking access to a totally different culture that was blocked off before! i could read joan miro's writings and interviews in their original language, for example..<br>
still reading the platypus book. the tendential rate of profit to fall is interesting and clear and i'd like to see it's importance extended. i think crisis theory in general is the most compelling aspect of reading marx thus far. climate change, pollution, urban sprawl, all aspects of the wasteful and destructive nature of the cmp, are wrapped up neatly with a little bow...
<br>
actually, what got me interested in giving socialism a chance in the first place was the fact that overproduction, fundamental to producing surplus-value, wouldn't be an aspect dealt with in resolving climate change if every nation-state somehow adopted a socdem political program (excluding the imperial periphery of course...)

it's not something you could talk extensively to me about, but it's the worst time period to be born a nature lover, so it's something i want to read into more.

<b>i'm going to rant about work for a bit</b>, so if you want skip go ahead. it's super boring.
<br>
work has been sort of busy which is unusual. that's unfortunately the only thing i did today actually related to my interests. admittedly i'm pretty spoiled-- i just have an email "job" (that in reality, probably only constitutes maybe 15 hours of actual work a week) where i just tell people how to reset their passwords. <br>
unfortunately, since i don't want anyone to catch on that i don't do much, i took up a "project" where i basically just add columns in excel, and now i'm supposed to go to a two day long mandatory "teaching oppertunity" for it that's basically just going to be one big commerical. at least theres free food... things could be worse.<br>
i only mention it cause, it's really bewildering to me how much importance people ascribe to their jobs, compromising any interests that outside those of capital just so they can think the blood money they rake in is contributing to the world somehow. <br> 
it's frankly sad. i was talking to a coworker and she's afraid to retire because work was her only social and mental outlet. she just spends her free time laying in bed and playing games on her ipad because she's disabled and it's hard to do anything. thats just no way to live. i felt bad for her and wanted to tell her she sounds depressed, but if she acknowledged she was, then that would require her acknowledging that there's more to life than her job.<br>
i talked to her about my hobbies, and it was unintelligible to her that you could *learn things for fun*. "that's not related to your job though" uh yeah i mean that's the point!<br>
i mean i'm sure my experience is redudant with what i'm sure many others have experienced with coworkers of various "wet waffle" archetypes. those that get their mental stimulation from sorting excel tables. nobody gets mental stimulation from that.<br>
i like my coworkers, thank god they acknowledge these social rules not as a reality but mostly convention. it's weird, they're still liberals, theres a degree of recognition and we like to complain, but it doesn't esclate into really questioning much because well, they don't care and work is probably the dumbest place you could pick to talk about politics.

stupid obligatory rant about my ivory tower over.
