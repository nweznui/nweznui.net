ohh my place has been looking really cute lately... D got a ton of furniture (he sort of went on a spree..), and he also got a bunch of organizational stuff from ikea. our place is starting to look more finished, lived in. for years i've lived in mostly unfurnished apartments, usually because i was too broke to afford furniture i couldn't find at a charity shop (and even then, i'm taking some risk).<br>
we got a wooden console table, which now holds our keys, a piggy-bank of loose change and some dried flowers. a full-body mirror for our entryway door, no longer do i have to jump in front of the bathroom mirror to get an idea what my outfit looks like. i have a bedside table, which is very handsome and handy for storing whatever books we read at night. and a side-table for one of our chairs, it's clover shaped and a nice amber color. all of our furniture (mostly) matches, usually some shade of amber oak.

and we also sorted out the storage situation in the kitchen... D got this stackable shelf with closable iron doors, which has been perfect because we've been trying to prevent our cats from climbing our pantry shelves. (they have two cat towers, they're just stubborn!) on top of that, it's easier to organize and find things with more space, instead of just having to rummage through a bunch of stuff crammed into one shelf.

yeeees... and i've been lifting more. back to 3x a week now. i was bad for a while, only lifting 1x a week. i'm surprised i didn't have to deload.

i've been reading d.k. ching's books on architecture. i really want to start drawing enviornments more often, especially from imagination. i'm decent at the figure, not great, but it's time to throw some other subjects in the mix of my study so i can expand my visual library.

my goal as an artist is to work as-stream-of-conciousness as possible, while still maintaining a high degree of technical aptitude. jules de bruycker is my favorite artist, and though such little information is available i can only speculate as to his methods, i can make some inferences by comparing artists who do document their processes of building imaginative scenes. (such as james gurney, whose stuff i find kinda kistch, but he's an incredible resource)

using reference occassionally is good and fine, but sometimes it can interfere with your ability to make creative design desicions when you rely too much on your reference. and the stories i've been writing are very dreamlike in nature. so i'm ok with a little leeway in the "feasability" of my designs, as long as they provoke the feeling of a place/person/thing and are visually interesting.
